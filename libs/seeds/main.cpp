 * 
 * **How to use the command line tool?**
 * 
 * Compile both the library in `/lib` as well as `cli/main.cpp` using CMake (see
 * `README.md`). The provided options can be viewed using 
 * 
 *  $ ./bin/cli --help
 *  Allowed options:
 *   --help                          produce help message
 *   --input arg                     the folder to process, may contain several 
 *                                   images
 *   --bins arg (=5)                 number of bins used for color histograms
 *   --neighborhood arg (=1)         neighborhood size used for smoothing prior
 *   --confidence arg (=0.100000001) minimum confidence used for block update
 *   --iterations arg (=2)           iterations at each level
 *   --spatial-weight arg (=0.25)    spatial weight
 *   --superpixels arg (=400)        desired number of supüerpixels
 *   --process                       show additional information while processing
 *   --csv                           save segmentation as CSV file
 *   --contour                       save contour image of segmentation
 *   --mean                          save mean colored image of segmentation
 *   --output arg (=output)          specify the output directory (default is 
 *                                   ./output)
